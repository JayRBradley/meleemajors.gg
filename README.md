# meleemajors.com

- a sample copy of `meleemajors.com` taken from [the wayback machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20221202045414/https://www.meleemajors.com/), with some small tweaks to make the site function

- because of this, any outgoing links will go to wayback machine versions of those sites

- to try out this website, I use a program to host the site locally (I use `live-server`, but any equivalent works just as well)
